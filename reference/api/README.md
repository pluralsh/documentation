# 👩💻 Developer Tools / API

Plural has two main components, each with their own graphql API:

* [Plural](broken-reference) - available at [https://app.plural.sh/gql](https://app.plural.sh/gql)
* [Plural Console](broken-reference) - deployable in any plural kubernetes cluster, and accessible at `https://your.console.domain/gql`

Each have a graphiql dashboard which can be used to play around at will with the APIs. You can also use the schema explorer to view all the data types and query/mutation fields available for whatever automation you'd like to build.
