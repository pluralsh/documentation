description: Applications you can install with Plural.
---

Here is where all the documentation for configuring the installation of your Plural apps live. Currently, we only have
docs for a handful of applications, but we will be adding them for our most used and requested repos.

Check out the full list of our onboarded applications [here](https://www.plural.sh/marketplace). 

## Application Updates

We use a tool called [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) to automate creation of PRs to update Application version images to newer versions. [Here](https://github.com/pluralsh/plural-artifacts/pull/288) is an example of one of these PRs.

Once we have tried out the changes and have confirmed that the new version works, we will merge the PR and the change will be available for
all Plural installations to pull down when they wish to.
