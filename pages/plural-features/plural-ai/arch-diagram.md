description: Agentic Search of Your Infrastructure to Generate Arch Diagrams and More
---

The best way to understand complex software infrastructure is to find a way to diagram it out to get to a visual representation of the data at hand.  Plural AI has all the tools to automate this process in many cases, even across cloud and kubernetes boundaries.  In particular, Plural has a few key datasources that enable an agentic diagramming engine:

1. A constantly refreshing semantic index of your infrastructure generated by our GitOps engine
2. The ability to reference source code and terraform state when necessary in an agentic process
3. The ability to live query Kubernetes or your cloud when necessary to fill in needed gaps

We are also actively working on ebpf network inspection which will improve this source data even more

That enables our AI to draft basic arch diagrams with a simple prompt.

## Create a Research Session

Diagram creation is simple and UI-based. Navigate to `AI -> Infra Research`.  You'll have a prompt button to spawn a new research, and from there you'll see a few threads spawn in as the AI is working in the background.  The process takes about 1-2 minutes, and is completely headless, so feel free to grab a coffee while its churning. Once done, you'll have a full result looking something like (using the prompt `Show me the architecture of the grafana deployment`):

![](/assets/ai/research-analysis.png)

This will have:

1. A complete architecture diagram of the infrastructure tied to your prompt
2. A text summary of the infrastructure and any other learnings found
3. A list of notes of what the AI still doesn't seem to understand from its investigation
4. A list of associated Plural Services and Stacks used as source data for the investigation

The graph itself is created in [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) format, and can be quite complex.  This can easily lead to hallucinations.  To correct these you have two tools:

1. AI fix - we provide a fix with ai button that will take any javascript errors from mermaid parsing and attempt to correct them.
2. Try it again - in other cases, it's oftentimes easier to just rerun the generation.  You can use the `Try Again` button to do this. 

## Publish Your Research

Once you feel like the diagram and research is suitable for broader acceptance, you can chose to publish it.  From there, anyone can view your research results and we'll index it for use in other investigations in the future.
