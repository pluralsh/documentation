description: Setting up SCM webhooks and automatically linking Pull Requests to Plural Flows

# Overview

Plural utilizes SCM (Source Control Management) webhooks to monitor pull request events and integrate with your development workflow. This allows Plural Flows to automatically link associated pull requests, providing seamless tracking and visibility.

## Setting up SCM Webhooks

To enable features like automatic PR status labeling and linking PRs to Plural Flows, you need to configure an SCM webhook.

### Prerequisites

*   **Plural Console `admin` Permissions**
*   **SCM Provider Personal Access Token** (Refer to provider documentation for creation: [Github](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic), [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html#create-a-personal-access-token), [Bitbucket](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/access-tokens/))
*   **SCM Provider Organization `admin` Permissions** (Required only when creating the webhook initially)

### Creating the Webhook in Plural

1.  **Navigate to `https://{your-console-domain}/pr/scm-webhooks`** in your Plural Console.
2.  **Click the `Create Webhook` Button** at the top right.
3.  **Fill in the Required Fields**:
    *   **Provider Type**: Select the SCM Provider (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
    *   **Owner**: The Organization or Group within the SCM Provider.
    *   **Secret**: A shared secret for webhook verification. You can generate one using `plural crypto random`.

### Configuring the Webhook in your SCM Provider

Now, use the copied Webhook URL and secret to create a webhook within your SCM provider's settings. You can typically configure this at the repository or organization/group level.

*   **Payload URL**: Paste the Webhook URL copied from the Plural Console.
*   **Content type**: Set to `application/json`.
*   **Secret**: Enter the secret you created in the Plural Console.
*   **Events**: Configure the webhook to trigger for **Pull Request** events. Ensure it includes events for opening, closing, reopening, and editing pull requests.

Refer to your SCM provider's documentation for specific instructions:

*   [Github Repository Webhooks](https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks/using-webhooks/creating-webhooks#creating-a-repository-webhook)
*   [GitHub Organization Webhooks](https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks/using-webhooks/creating-webhooks#creating-an-organization-webhook)
*   [GitLab Project Webhooks](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/webhooks.html#configure-a-webhook-in-gitlab) (Ensure "Pull request events" is checked)
*   [GitLab Group Webhooks](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/webhooks.html#group-webhooks)
*   [Bitbucket Webhooks](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/manage-webhooks-938025878.html) (Select "Pull request" > "Created", "Updated", "Merged", "Declined" triggers)

## Linking Pull Requests to Plural Flows

Once the SCM webhook is correctly configured, Plural can automatically link pull requests to their corresponding Plural Flows.

To link a pull request, simply include the following text anywhere in the **pull request body (description)**:

```
Plural Flow: {flow-name}
```

Replace `{flow-name}` with the exact name of the Plural Flow you want to link the PR to.

When Plural receives the webhook event for the PR creation or update, it will parse the body, find this text, and establish the link between the PR and the specified Flow within the Plural UI. This allows you to easily navigate between a Flow and its related development work.
