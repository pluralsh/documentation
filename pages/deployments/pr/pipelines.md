title: PR Automation Pipelines
description: Use PR Automations to generate revisions throughout a Pipeline
---

Plural Pipelines do not ordinarily require human intervention to deploy the services within them, instead relying on common conventions like passing along git shas plus configured secrets to ferry along code changes. That said, there are still cases where you would like a PR to perform each update:

- Robust GitOps flows where you need an auditable approval for each change
- Cases where other automations (eg GitOps app-of-apps or terraform) could interfere with the changes from a pipeline

Plural PR Automation pipelines provide a simple but highly configurable means of providing extensible, auditable, yet automated workflows that can meet those sorts of constraints.

## Setup

Here's a quick and dirty dev to prod pipeline with pr automations to execute the changes in each stage:

in `dev.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: deployments.plural.sh/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceDeployment
metadata:
  name: podinfo-dev
spec:
  name: podinfo
  namespace: podinfo
  helm:
    chart: podinfo
    version: 6.5.3 # VERSION
    repository:
      name: podinfo
      namespace: infra
  clusterRef:
    kind: Cluster
    name: boot-staging
    namespace: infra
```

in `prod.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: deployments.plural.sh/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceDeployment
metadata:
  name: podinfo-prod
spec:
  name: podinfo
  namespace: podinfo
  helm:
    chart: podinfo
    version: 6.5.3 # VERSION
    repository:
      name: podinfo
      namespace: infra
  clusterRef:
    kind: Cluster
    name: boot-prod
    namespace: infra
```

in `pipeline.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: deployments.plural.sh/v1alpha1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  name: pr-automation
spec:
  stages:
    - name: dev
      services:
        - serviceRef:
            name: podinfo-dev
            namespace: infra
          criteria:
            prAutomationRef:
              name: podinfo-pipeline
    - name: prod
      services:
        - serviceRef:
            name: podinfo-prod
            namespace: infra
          criteria:
            prAutomationRef:
              name: podinfo-pipeline
  edges:
    - from: dev
      to: prod
      gates:
        - name: approval-gate
          type: APPROVAL
```

in `prautomation.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: deployments.plural.sh/v1alpha1
kind: PrAutomation
metadata:
  name: podinfo-pipeline
spec:
  name: podinfo-pipeline
  documentation: Updates the podinfo service to a specified helm version for any pipeline stage
  updates:
    regexReplacements:
      - regex: 'version: (.*) # VERSION'
        file: apps/pipeline/{{ context.pipeline.stage.name }}.yaml
        replacement: 'version: {{ context.version }} # VERSION'
  scmConnectionRef:
    name: gh-test
  title: 'Updating pod info prod helm version to {{ context.version }} (stage={{ context.pipeline.stage.name }})'
  message: 'Updating pod info prod helm version to {{ context.version }} (stage={{ context.pipeline.stage.name }})'
  identifier: pluralsh/plrl-boot-aws
  configuration:
    - name: version
      type: STRING
      documentation: The helm chart version to use
```

## How it works

The `{dev,prod}.yaml` files configure the two podinfo services. Notice the `# VERSION` comment in each, that's simply designed to simplify the regex logic that's ultimately used by the pr automation in `prautomation.yaml` and is a generally useful trick in configuring these workflows.

The PR Automation itself is templated, and utilizes the default `pipeline` object to infer the stage in which its applied to reduce the configuration burden for you. When triggered by the dev stage, it'll work off the `apps/pipeline/dev.yaml` file, and similarly the `apps/pipeline/prod.yaml` file for the prod stage.

The Pipeline yaml file configures the pipeline end-to-end, and you can see each stage service has promotion criteria pointing to the configured pr automation. That tells the pipeline to trigger the pr creation process when that stage is active. To move from dev -> prod, a manual approval is required, as specified in the edge configuration.

## Kicking a run off

To initiate the pipeline, you need to create a pipeline context, which you can do easily via CRD, eg:

```yaml
apiVersion: deployments.plural.sh/v1alpha1
kind: PipelineContext
metadata:
  name: podinfo-context
spec:
  pipelineRef:
    name: pr-automation
    namespace: infra
  context:
    version: 6.5.4
```
