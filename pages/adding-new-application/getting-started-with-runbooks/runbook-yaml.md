Each datasource has a type. At the moment, the only types Plural supports are prometheus, kubernetes, and nodes. Each type has a spec that's specific to the type.&#x20;

*   prometheus

    spec:&#x20;

    * format
    * legend
    * query
*   kubernetes

    spec:

    * resource&#x20;
    * name -- the namespace of the kubernetes resource
*   nodes

    This just fetches all the nodes in the Kubernetes cluster

Additionally, in `runbooks.yaml`, you can define a specific action that the runbook can take based off of context from what the user input has given it.

For example, in the file above, we've defined an action that allows the runbook to update the [home values file](https://github.com/pluralsh/plural-artifacts/blob/760ad90c55d42a8f3081d6e5082c8a8e508ef1b4/ghost/helm/ghost/values.yaml) for that installation. It's done by yaml path, which means it will recursively update `ghost.resources.request.cpu`.

This will update the yaml file, save it back, issue a commit, and create a build in the console to actually apply the change.
