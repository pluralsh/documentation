title: Integrate with your Source Control Provider
description: Set Up a SCM Connection in Plural to integrate with Github, GitLab, or BitBucket
---

# Overview

Plural has the ability to spawn pull requests, post review comments, and other functionality to integrate with your standard SCM (Source Control Management) workflows.  The most impactful of these is the PR Automation api, which allows you to spawn templated pull requests to do common tasks like:

* provision new clusters
* drive deployment pipelines
* in conjunction with Stacks, provision associated kubernetes or cloud infrastructure (databases, IAM, networks)

To get this working you'll first need to give your Plural Console scoped access tokens to your SCM.

# Prerequisites
Some things you'll need to run this tutorial:

* **Plural Console `admin` Permissions**  
* **SCM Provider Personal Access Token**
  * [Github](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic)  
  * [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html#create-a-personal-access-token)  
  * [Bitbucket](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/access-tokens/)
* **SCM Provider Organization `admin` Permissions**
  * This is only required when creating the webhook
  * The workload cluster can still be created without the SCM webhook

## Create a New SCM Connection

Creating an SCM Connection is easiest just using our UI.  You can then reference that created resource via k8s CRD to drive other workflows.  Step by step, you'll want to:

* **Navigate to `https://{your-console-domain}/pr/scm`**  
* **Click the _Create Connection_ Button at the Top Right**  
* **Fil in the Required Fields**
  * **Provider Type**: The SCM Provider Hosting Git Repositories  
  * **Name**: Reference Name for the Provider  
    * ℹ️ **NOTE**: The _cluster-creator_ PR Automation looks for `github` by default, but is arbitrary and can be changed
  * **Token**: The Deploy Token to use.
* **Click `Create`**

{% callout severity="info" %}
For `github` tokens, the minimal permissions needed will be `repo` permissions.  You can also use a Github App if you'd like the token to not be scoped to a specific user.  For Github Apps, recommended permisions are read/write for Code, Pull Requests and Workflows (so you can write PR Automations for Github Actions, but technically optional).
{% /callout %}

## **Create an [`ScmConnection`](/deployments/operator/api#scmconnection) CRD Instance**  

Once the connection is created in the UI we can reference it with a CRD instance
  * ❕ Ensure the Name Provided in the UI matches the `spec.name` in the CRD Exactly
  * An [`ScmConnection`](/deployments/operator/api#scmconnection) yaml template for GitHub exists in `bootstrap/pr-automation/scm.yaml`, you'll simply need to uncomment it. It should look like this:

# Set Up
### Create a New SCM Connection
* **Navigate to `https://console.[YOUR DOMAIN].onplural.sh/pr/scm`**  
* **Click the _Create Connection_ Button at the Top Right**  
![Create SCM Connection Button](/images/how-to/console_create-scm-btn.png)

* **Fil in the Required Fields**
  * **Provider Type**: The SCM Provider Hosting Git Repositories  
  * **Name**: Reference Name for the Provider  
    * ℹ️ **NOTE**: The _cluster-creator_ PR Automation looks for `github` by default
  * **Token**: The Deploy Token to use

### **Create an [`ScmConnection`](https://docs.plural.sh/deployments/operator/api#scmconnection) CRD Instance**  
Once the connection is created in the UI we can reference it with a CRD instance
  * ❕ Ensure the Name Provided in the UI matches the `spec.name` in the CRD Exactly
  * The [`ScmConnection`](https://docs.plural.sh/deployments/operator/api#scmconnection) yaml can be saved in your MGMT Cluster Repo
  * You can use `kubectl` to apply it to the MGMT cluster

```yaml
apiVersion: deployments.plural.sh/v1alpha1
kind: ScmConnection
metadata:
  name: github
spec:
  name: github
  type: GITHUB
```
<<<<<<< HEAD

You should now be able to commit and push, and Plural will sync it in (or create a PR to merge it into your main branch):

```sh
git commit -m "setup a Plural scm connection"
git push
```

{% callout severity="info" %}
`plural up` by default creates an `apps` service syncing all subfolders of the `bootstrap` folder in the repo it creates.  Since we created this file in `bootstrap/pr-automation` that means that root service-of-services will sync it appropriately and we just need to `git push` to apply the change.
{% /callout %}

## **Add an SCM Provider Webhook**

Plural listens to incoming PRs to drive a couple of workflows:

* labeling the status of spawned PRs generated by PR Automations.  Without a webhook, they'll just remain OPEN perpetually.
* listening for PRs linked to stacks so we can generate `plan` runs for terraform/pulumi/etc, and post-back the results as a PR comment.

If you want that functionality, simply add a webhook in your SCM by doing the following:

* **Navigate to `https://{your-console-domain}/pr/scm-webhooks`**  
* **Click the `Create Webhook` Button**  
=======
### **Add an SCM Provider Webhook**
If you navigate to `https://console.[YOUR DOMAIN].onplural.sh/pr/queue`  
You'll see even though the SCM connection is complete  
and the PR is merged the status of the cluster creator PR is still _open_  

We need to add an SCM Webhook to fix this.  
* **Navigate to `https://console.[YOUR DOMAIN].onplural.sh/pr/scm-webhooks`**  
* **Click the `Create Webhook` Button**

* **Fill the Required Fields**
  * **Provider Type**: The SCM Provider Hosting Git Repositories
      * This may be obvious, but you need to select the same provider as the console webhook
  * **Owner**: The Organization or Group Within the SCM Provider

  * **Secret**: The Webhook Secret to Share, you can generate a cryptographically secure one with `plural crypto random`

* **Create the Webhook with the SCM Provider**  

You can create this webhook at whatever scope you'd prefer.  Depending on the scope, the permissions needed will likely vary.  A simple place to start is just creating a webhook scoped to your `plural up` repository.

Here's some docs to help you work through the webhook creation process for a lot of SCM providers:

  * [Github Repository Webhooks](https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks/using-webhooks/creating-webhooks#creating-a-repository-webhook)
  * [GitHub Organization Webhooks](https://docs.github.com/en/webhooks/using-webhooks/creating-webhooks#creating-an-organization-webhook)
  * [GitLab Group Webhooks](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/webhooks.html#group-webhooks)
  * [Bitbucket Webhooks](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/manage-webhooks-938025878.html)

# Troubleshooting

#### Get Kubeconfig for the MGMT Cluster
```sh
plural wkspace kube-init
```

Use `kubectl` with the newly added kube context  
The key namespaces to check are:   
* plrl-console
* plrl-deploy-operator
* plrl-runtime

#### Check the Status of the SCM Connection
```sh
kubectl describe ScmConnection github
```
Take note of the status conditions.  
The Messages will provide failure or success messages.
