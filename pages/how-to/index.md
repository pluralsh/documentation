These tutorials will guide you through a miniaturized example of the Kubernetes adoption process.  The basic steps are:

1. Setup your management cluster
2. Setup a few workload clusters to separate dev and prod workloads
3. Setup a base kubernetes runtime, in this case for managing networking w/ ingress, cert-manager, and external-dns
4. Deploy dev + prod microservices
5. Setup Pipelines between them.

We also go into a few other usecases that will often become useful, in particular:

* Implementing cloud self-service with our PR Automation and Terraform Stacks APIs.
* Integrating closely with your source control provider, to tightly integrate your deployment workflows with the code review and approval process.
