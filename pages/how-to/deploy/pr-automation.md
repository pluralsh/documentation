title: Use PR Automations for General Self-Service
description: Use a PR Automation for an example Self-Service S3 bucket creation workflow
---

# Overview

Cloud infrastructure changes rapidly, and often the manual nature of infrastructure-as-code workflows can become a drag on velocity, causing organizations to reach to more self-service approaches.  This can involve stitching together Backstage, Gitlab, ArgoCD, or any other set of tools.  Plural provides a single cloud orchestrator to provide all those key functionalities in one control plane.

We'll show how this can work beyond just a K8s provisioning usecase, to provisioning an S3 bucket, a common resource also needed by Kubernetes workloads.  It'll operate by:

* Creating a PR Automation (PRA) to make the provisioning of buckets repeatable
* Using that PRA to create an `InfrastructureStack` to provision the s3 bucket using a Plural terraform stack.

## Define the PR Automation

This PR Automation is going to leverage resources that have already been created in the `plural up` repo for you, in particular:

* `terraform/modules/blob/s3` - a basic s3 bucket module we've predefined that can be used for provisioning the bucket
* `templates/blobstore/*` - a couple of templates that will be used to setup the blobstore provisioning process via a PRA

Given those manifests, the PR Automation yaml could be something like this, which you'd place in `bootstrap/pr-automation/blobstore.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: deployments.plural.sh/v1alpha1
kind: PrAutomation
metadata:
  name: blob-creator
spec:
  name: blob-creator
  documentation: |
    Sets up a PR to provision a blobstore with a given type (eg s3) and region
  creates:
    templates:
    - source: templates/blob/stack.yaml
      destination: "services/blobstores/{{ context.type }}/{{ context.name }}.yaml"
      external: false
    - source: templates/blob/service.yaml
      destination: "bootstrap/blobstores.yaml"
      external: false
  scmConnectionRef:
    name: github
  title: "Adding a {{ context.type }} bucket {{ context.name }}"
  message: "Setup a stack to manage the {{ context.name }} {{ context.type }} bucket"
  identifier: your-org/your-plural-up-repo # <---- replace with the slug for your plural up repo
  configuration:
  - name: name
    type: STRING
    documentation: the name of this blob store (if using s3, this would become an s3 bucket name)
    validation:
      regex: "[a-z][a-z\-0-9]+"
  - name: type
    type: ENUM
    documentation: the type of blob storage to provision
    values:
    - s3
  - name: region
    type: STRING
    documentation: the region your blobstore will live in
```

Breaking down what this resource does, since it's somewhat complicated:

* It'll create a self-service wizard in the Plural UI to provision new blobstores. The inputs to that wizard are defined in `spec.configuration`.  The API will also typecheck each input provided to ensure everything is sane (notice the name field also has an additional regex validation to ensure properly formatted names are provided).
* It'll write two files:
    1. `bootstrap/blobstores.yaml` - this creates a service to own each of the blobstores.  This is just to prevent the main `apps` service synced under the `bootstrap` folder doesn't become too bloated.
    2. `services/blobstores/{type}/{name}.yaml` - This records the actual `InfrastructureStack` crd which configures the Stack which will own deployment of this instance of the `terraform/modules/blob/s3` stack.
* Finally it'll create a PR with those changes against the source repo configured at `spec.identifier`.  The `scmConnectionRef` provided will need permissions to create PRs and push to this repo for that to work.

## Push to Deploy

We registered all these manifests under the root `bootstrap` folder a `plural up`-derived management cluster listens to by default, so all you should need to do is either:

```sh
git commit -m "setup blobstore pr automation"
git push
```

or create a PR, approve it, and merge to have this new pr automation deploy.  

{% callout severity="info" %}
You might need to wait a minute or two for the system to poll git and realize there's a new change.
{% /callout %}

Once you've configured all of these, you should see the new PR Automation at https://{your-console-domain}/pr/automations.

## Execute the PR Automation And Merge

Once the PR Automation is created, the process is very straightforward

1. Go to https://{your-console-domain}/pr/automations
2. Click `Create PR` on the row with your new automation, and enter the wizard.  This will create a new PR
3. Wait for the `apps` service to sync, or manually sync it with the UI.
4. Go to https://console.mgmt.plural.sh/stacks and find a stack named blobstore-{name}.  This should have a run either in-progress or `Pending Approval`.
5. Validate the `terraform plan` in that run, either using the dedicated `Plan` tab or the command output.  Click `Approve`.

Once `terraform apply` completes, you should have a new S3 bucket!

## Generalizing the workflow

This is relatively overkill if you're just creating an S3 bucket, but the pattern can be easily generalized to other cloud provisioning usecases.  The general flow is:

1. Write a single terraform module to accomplish the goal, eg creating a RDS database, or S3 bucket, or Azure Virtual Network.
2. Write a few liquid templates to define how these will be instantiated as `InfrastructureStack` resources, and maybe how to chain syncs via services descended from the main `bootstrap` folder.  (That's the purpose of the `bootstrap/blobstores.yaml` file).
3. Write a PRA to automate generation of the files from (2).
4. Profit!
