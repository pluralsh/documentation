We run a continuous Contributor Program to help maintain our catalog from the community.  The bounties for the various tasks are as follows:

* $100 for an application update (note that many applications should auto-update)
* $250 for an application onboarding

To qualify for the bounty, you'll need to submit a PR to https://github.com/pluralsh/scaffolds.git and once it's been approved and merged, DM a member of the Plural staff on Discord to receive your payout.
