description: 'Learn how to deploy a Grafana instance using Helm chart with inline configuration values, including ingress setup and TLS configuration'
---

## Overview

In this guide, you'll learn how to deploy Grafana (a popular monitoring tool) on your Kubernetes cluster using Plural.
We'll show you how to use Helm charts - think of them as pre-packaged applications - with inline configuration values,
which means we'll define all our settings directly in the deployment file. This approach makes it easy to manage and
update your applications.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure to cover [prerequisites and setup](../#prerequisites), and that you have:
- `cert-manager`, ingress controller and `externaldns` installed in the target cluster.

{% callout severity="info" %}
When using `plural up` and the `mgmt` as the target cluster `cert-manager`, `nginx-ingress` and `externaldns` will already be installed.
{% /callout %}

## Step-by-Step Guide: Deploying Grafana with Inline Helm Values
Let's walk through deploying Grafana using a Helm chart with inline configuration values. Feel free to adjust provided file
examples according to your needs and commit them to your configured Git repository under the `apps` directory. There is a
default `apps` service that deploys all resources from that directory.

### Step 1: Create a ServiceDeployment resource
Create our service deployment that uses a remote helm chart and inline values to deploy a fully
functional Grafana instance.

##### [apps/examples/helm-basic-with-inline-values/servicedeployment.yaml](https://github.com/pluralsh/scaffolds/blob/main/examples/helm-basic-with-inline-values/servicedeployment.yaml)
```yaml
apiVersion: deployments.plural.sh/v1alpha1
kind: ServiceDeployment
metadata:
  name: plrl-01-grafana
  namespace: examples
spec:
  helm:
    # Remote helm repository
    url: https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
    # Chart within that repository that should be deployed
    chart: grafana
    # Version can use an exact version or 'x' to allow patch/minor/major version bumps without user interaction
    version: x.x.x  # Replace with your desired version or leave as is to always use the latest version
    values:
      # Our custom inline values
      ingress:
        enabled: true
        annotations:
          cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: plural
        ingressClassName: nginx
        hosts:
          - grafana-test.your-domain.com
        tls:
          - hosts:
              - grafana-test.your-domain.com
            secretName: grafana-tls
  # A reference to the cluster resource instance we've created in the previous step
  clusterRef:
    kind: Cluster
    name: mgmt
    namespace: examples
```

### Step 2: Check Plural Console and access Grafana
After a couple of minutes, service should be deployed and running. 
![](/assets/examples/plrl-01-console.png 'CD tab -> mgmt cluster -> plrl-01-grafana service')

Grafana should now be accessible at the configured address.

## Key Takeaways

Congratulations! You've just learned how to:

- Deploy an application (Grafana) using Helm charts in Plural
- Connect your deployment to a specific cluster
- Configure your application using inline values (settings written directly in the file)
- Set up secure access to your application with TLS (https)
- Monitor your deployment using Plural Console

This example shows you the basics of deploying applications on Plural. You can use this same approach to deploy other
applications - just change the Helm chart and adjust the configuration values to match your needs. Remember, the Plural
Console is always there to help you monitor and manage your deployments.
