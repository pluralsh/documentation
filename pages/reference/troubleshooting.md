# ðŸª› Troubleshooting

## error: exec plugin: invalid apiVersion "client.authentication.k8s.io/v1alpha1" error: exec plugin: invalid apiVersion "client.authentication.k8s.io/v1alpha1" exit status 1

You might see this when attempting to sync crds or run helm commands in a run of `plural deploy`. It's due to legacy versions of the aws cli generating deprecated kubeconfigs, if you upgrade your cli and rerun `plural deploy` it should be able to proceed successfully.

## Error 404: The requested project was not found., notFound

If you are running `plural build` and encounter a `project requested not found` error it's possible that your application default credential is set to the wrong gcp project. Run:

```
gcloud auth application-default login
```

to reset the credential and reauthorize the browser for the correct project.

## Error Acquiring State Lock

If your deploy is interrupted, it's possible terraform state gets confused. To fix this, you'll need to:

```
cd <app-name>/terraform
terraform force-unlock <lock-id>
```

You should be able to find the state lock id from the error message. Terraform stacks for each app are located in a standard terraform folder each time.

## May not specify more than one provider type

If you are running `plural deploy` and encounter the error below there may be stale state from the previous install.

```
Error: UPGRADE FAILED: cannot patch "letsencrypt-prod" with kind ClusterIssuer: admission webhook "webhook.cert-manager.io" denied the request: spec.acme.solvers[0].dns01.route53: Forbidden: may not specify more than one provider type
```

Run:

```
helm del bootstrap -n bootstrap
plural deploy
```

## error reading Route Table Association () : Empty result

This is a possible terraform race condition where the route tables think they're being read before they've been created, but in fact, they have already been created. As a temporary fix, just wait some time and rerun the deploy:

```
plural deploy
```

## Cloud resource limits exceeded

It's possible plural will deploy resources that exceed your cloud limits. In general the most pessimistic of these are load balancer limits and VPC limits. Be sure you have headroom in both those dimensions. This can lead to terraform state corruption, in which case you'll need to do something along the lines of for all resources missing from your terraform state:

```
cd application-name/terraform
terraform import path_to_terraform_resource resource_id
```

If you devise a better way to recover crashed terraform state, please give us a shout in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/pluralsh). We'd love to automate this better.

## IAM policy update 403 permission denied

You will see permission errors if your Cloud account does not have permissions to create the IAM roles needed by Plural. Apply the correct permissions to the user account that Plural is deploying as.
