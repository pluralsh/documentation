# Plural API

You can explore the plural API in more depth using our graphiql console, viewable at [https://app.plural.sh/graphiql](https://app.plural.sh/graphiql).

You'll need to do two things to allow the graphiql interface to be functional:

* Configure the endpoint to point to [https://app.plural.sh/gql](https://app.plural.sh/gql)
* Add your access token as an authorization header with `Bearer <access token>` as the format.

You can use the docs [here](../../advanced-topics/identity-and-access-management/api-tokens.md) to learn how to create API tokens
