Plural has two main components, each with their own graphql API:

- [Plural](https://app.plural.sh/graphiql) - available at `https://app.plural.sh/gql`
- [Plural Console](https://app.plural.sh/repository/a051a0bf-61b5-4ab5-813d-2c541c83a979) - deployable in any plural kubernetes cluster, and accessible at `https://console.domain.com/gql`

Each have a graphiql dashboard which can be used to play around at will with the APIs. You can also use the schema explorer to view all the data types and query/mutation fields available for whatever automation you'd like to build.
