{% callout severity="info" title="How do we calculate cloud costs?" %}
Plural deploys a standard configuration on each cloud provider and uses provider-specific price lists to estimate an infrastructure cost for the deployment of your applications. Each initial deployment has a certain amount of headroom for installing applications and will scale accordingly as more are added. Costs to Plural are calculated based on which plan is chosen; Plural Professional is priced by the number of users and clusters.

{% callout severity="info" title="What is a cluster?" %}
A cluster is a set of worker machines (called nodes) that run containerized applications. A single cluster can contain many different applications that work together to perform various workflows. A single cluster is often sufficient for getting started, but it can be beneficial in some circumstances to have multiple clusters running (e.g., a development and production cluster).
