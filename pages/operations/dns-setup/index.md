{% tab title="New Domain" %}
#### 1. Register a Domain Name

This domain name, eg `pluraldemo.com` can be registered with any registrar, for example Google Domains, GoDaddy, or Namecheap.

#### 2. Create a DNS Zone in Your Cloud Provider Console Corresponding to the registered Domain Name

Follow [the instructions](/operations/dns-setup/creating-dns-zone-in-your-cloud-provider-console) for creating a DNS Zone named `pluraldemo.com` within the DNS service of your cloud provider.

Record the nameservers corresponding to this zone.

#### 3. Update name servers

Go back to where you registered `pluraldemo.com`and add the nameservers from Step 2 as "custom nameservers" under its DNS configuration.

{% callout severity="info" %}
The domain name registrars will typically provide default name servers and also the ability to set up custom name servers. For example, in Google Domains, you can set custom name servers under the DNS tab once you click into a specific domain name.

{% tab title="Subdomain of Existing Domain" %}
The more likely scenario is that you will have an existing company domain, i.e. `pinterest.com` and you will want to create a subdomain under which you can consolidate all your plural applications, eg `plural.pinterest.com`

#### 1. Create DNS Zone in Your Cloud Provider Console

Follow [the instructions](/operations/dns-setup/creating-dns-zone-in-your-cloud-provider-console) for creating a DNS Zone named `plural.pinterest.com` within the DNS service of your cloud provider.

Record the nameservers corresponding to this zone.

#### 2. Create NS Record

Go back to where you registered `pinterest.com` and add a `NS` record that corresponds to the `plural.pinterest.com` subdomain -- for the data field of the record, input the nameservers from step 1.

These are the terraform snippets for reference:

```
resource "aws_route53_zone" "test" {
  name = "plural.pinterest.com"

  tags = {
    Environment = "test"
  }
}

resource "aws_route53_record" "test-ns" {
  zone_id = data.aws_route53_zone.main.zone_id
  name    = "plural.pinterest.com"
  type    = "NS"
  ttl     = "30"
  records = aws_route53_zone.test.name_servers
}
```
{% /tab %}
{% /tabs %}

# Configuring Externaldns for your cluster

There are two ways this can be done:

* for a new cluster
* for an existing cluster using plural's dns service you want to switch over

## Fresh Cluster

For a fresh cluster, you'll be prompted in `plural init` whether you want to enable plural dns.  Simply answer no, provide the subdomain you created above, and we'll configure externaldns correctly for you from the start.

## Existing Plural Cluster

For existing clusters, there's a bit of cleanup you'll need to do to reconfigure from plural dns.  You'll want to edit the `workspace.yaml` file at the root of your repo to set `false` to the `pluralDns` entry.  You'll also want to rewire the subdomain to point to your new subdomain so domain validation works in the future.

Additionally, in the `context.yaml` file, there will likely be a number of dns entries in the configuration for your apps, you'll want to move those to the new subdomain as well (the old plural dns records will still work during this transition).

Once all this is done, you can reconfigure all the helm charts with `plural build` then run `plural deploy` to apply them.
