# Installing Plural Console

## Introduction

The plural admin console is a web application that serves as a control panel for all your plural applications. It:

* manages automated upgrades delivered from the Kubernetes api
* serves as a thin Grafana to visualize application metrics and logs
* serves as a built-in k8s dashboard for all plural apps in the cluster, along with providing app-level health checking
* is the touchpoint at which incidents can be filed with the owner of an application

The console is not a strict dependency, but it is highly recommended to install it. It can be installed and deployed like any other application on Plural. For more detailed instructions, please refer to [this guide](admin-console.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
The admin console is separate from [app.plural.sh](https://app.plural.sh) which is primarily a package registry.
{% endhint %}

## Installation

#### 1. Check whether your Plural installation repo uses https or ssh for Git authentication

```
# show repo remote with details
git remote -v
```

If the remote urls start with `git@github.com` then you're using ssh

If the remote urls start with `https` then you're using https.

#### 2. Setup for Git authentication

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Https" %}
Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) to generate a revokable personal access token. The access token needs to have write permissions. Keep track of this access token, you will need it later in the console install process.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="SSH" %}
Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) if you are using Github to generate a ssh key and add it to your ssh-agent and Github account.

Keep track of the path where you've stored your ssh key (most likely in \~/.ssh/id\_rsa); you will need this later.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

#### 3. Install Console bundle && build

The plural console is installable like any other plural app. To find the available bundles, just run:

```
plural bundle list console
```

Then once you've found an eligible bundle to install, do:

```
plural bundle install console <bundle-name>
```

You will now be guided through a configuration wizard. If you have any questions about a specific parameter, refer to [this document](../repositories/console.md).

Once the bundle has installed, run:

```
plural build
```

\
The console takes over the gitops flow of managing plural apps for you. You will be asked for the git authentication credentials you created at Step 1.

#### 4. Deploy Console

Once the build has completed, run:

```
plural deploy --commit "installed console"
```

#### 5. Login to Console

Once the deploy finishes, it will output the url that the console has been deployed to. Navigate to that url and it will show a login screen that looks like this:

If you selected (y) to OIDC, one-login has already been configured, and you'll be able to sign in with the same credentials you use for `app.plural.sh`.

If you didn't select (y) to OIDC, your login credentials for this console are different from your login credentials for `app.plural.sh`. You can find them in`console/helm/console/values.yaml` under the `console.secrets.admin_username` and `console.secrets.admin_password` keys.

## Console Highlights

The console is the command center for your Plural applications, and it comes with built-in goodies. Some highlights include:

#### Runbooks

* The Plural console comes with interactive runbooks that serve as guided tutorials for advanced operations on Plural applications.

For example, the Airflow scaling runbook det

ails how to look the Airflow CPU and memory usage graphs and compute your reservation appropriately. It then allows you to make that reservation directly from the runbook.
