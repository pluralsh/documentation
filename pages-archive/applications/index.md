Here is where all the documentation for configuring the installation of your Plural apps live.

## Application Updates

We use a tool called [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) to automate creation of PRs to update Application version images to newer versions. [Here](https://github.com/pluralsh/plural-artifacts/pull/288) is an example of one of these PRs.

Once we have tried out the changes and have confirmed that the new version works, we will merge the PR and the change will be available for all Plural installations to pull down when they wish to.
