title: Add an Application
description: >-
  Is something missing from the Plural marketplace? Are you a vendor who wants
  to add your solution? We'd love for you to onboard your application! This
  guide outlines the process.
---

If you want to contribute your own application to the Plural marketplace we invite you to create and publish your own artifacts.
In this section we guide you through the ins and outs of Plural's application artifacts, how you can build your own with the tools that Plural provides you, and how you can publish them for others to use.

> We are focused on properly compensating any contributions to the Plural platform, which includes a meaningful [bounty](https://github.com/pluralsh/plural-artifacts#plural-contributor-program).
