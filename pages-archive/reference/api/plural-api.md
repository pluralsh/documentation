title: Plural API
---

You can explore the plural API in more depth using our graphiql console, viewable at [https://app.plural.sh/graphiql](https://app.plural.sh/graphiql).

You'll need to do two things to allow the graphiql interface to be functional:

- Configure the endpoint to point to `https://app.plural.sh/gql`
- Add your access token as an authorization header with `Bearer <access token>` as the format.
