title: Sharing Your Git Repositories
description: How to securely share a Plural workspace and Git repository with a collaborator.

Plural reimplements [git-crypt](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt) in its management of secret data within git. This provides transparent file access to users with the repo's AES key, along with full support for tooling like local diffs, while still providing full obfuscation of secret data when pushed to remote.

The encryption key is automatically generated by Plural and stored in Plural's config directory `~/.plural`. We provide commands for importing/exporting the key, as well as a mechanism for sharing the repo with multiple users using the successor to PGP, [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age).

## Sharing a Plural Git Repository

### Register a public key

To register a key for your current machine, run:

```shell {% showHeader=false %}
plural crypto setup-keys --name <name-for-key-pair>
```

This will generate a new keypair and automatically register the public key with the Plural API. You should be able to see it listed [here](https://app.plural.sh/profile/keys) in our web app and the keypair will be stored in `~/.plural/identity`.

If the user has not set up their plural cli yet, they'll need to run `plural login` to set up a local access token for your cli and other config files before running `plural crypto setup-keys`.

### Share the repository

To share a repo, use the following command:

```shell {% showHeader=false %}
plural crypto share --email <email1> --email <email2>
```

{% callout severity="info" %}
`--email` refers to a user's email associated with their Plural account
{% /callout %}

This will do a few things:

- create a base identity to encrypt the repo's current AES key and store it in a git-ignored place under `${REPO_ROOT}/.plural-crypt`.
- register all the users who have access in a yaml file under `${REPO_ROOT}/.plural-crypt`
- encrypt the file using all this information and store it under `${REPO_ROOT}/.plural-crypt`

If you have the Plural Console deployed, run:

```shell {% showHeader=false %}
plural build --only console
plural deploy
git add . && git commit -m "set up encryption"
git push
```

### Decrypt the repository

There are two ways the person you shared encryption can decrypt the repository. The simplest is to use the `plural clone` command:

```shell
plural clone git@github.com:your/repository.git
```

This will both run a standard git clone and then the following commands:

```shell
plural crypto init
plural crypto unlock
```

If you chose to run a standard `git clone``, the above commands would still be required.
