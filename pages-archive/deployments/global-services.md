description: Deploy services by default on specified clusters.

Global services are automatically replicated across existing and new clusters matching the set of defined specifications.

Once a service is deployed onto any cluster, it can be marked global by clicking the three dots in the deployments table and selecting "Make global".

Add cluster tags or a cluster provider to ensure that the service is only replicated on matching clusters.

Global services are denoted with the globe icon in the deployments table.
