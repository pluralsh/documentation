title: Find Credentials for non-OIDC Applications
description: Surface creds for applications without OIDC enabled

If you need to find credentials for an application that does not have OIDC enabled, run the following command in either the Cloud Shell or CLI:

```
plural info <app-name>
```

This will surface credentials and any other useful information about the application.
